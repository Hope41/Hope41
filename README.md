Well, hi there! I'm Hope41, a young independent developer who creates fully-featured games in pure JavaScript. Check out my work at [joachimford.uk](https://joachimford.uk)!

### Trivial Information

- 🎹 I play piano sometimes
- 📧 I like it when people email me
- ⭐ I really like stars! (like GitHub ones. Although of course I like normal stars as well. I have nothing against normal stars)
