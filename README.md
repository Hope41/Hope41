Well, hi there! I'm Hope41, a young independent developer who creates fully-featured games in pure JavaScript. Check out my work at [joachimford.uk](https://joachimford.uk)!

### Trivial Information
- 👾 You can call me J-oh for short!
- 📧 I like it when people email me
- ⭐ I really like stars! (you know, like, GitHub ones. Although of course I like normal stars as well. I have nothing against normal stars)
- 🎹 I play piano sometimes!
- 💬 Game feedback is welcome! Constructive criticism goes a long way ~
